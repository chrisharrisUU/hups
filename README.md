R code for 

HUPS project

[OSF Repository](https://osf.io/xxx/)



### Structure of the repository

The data files are organized as follows: The main scripts can be found in the folder `Analyses`. These scripts load the raw data (from the `Data` folder), as well as helper functions that have been outsourced to the `Auxiliary` folder. Output (in particular the graphs) is saved to the `Output` folder. Finally, the `Survey` folder includes stimulus material as well as the xml-files that make up the experiment as it was run on SosciSurvey.
